# benchmark-parser

Welcome to a glorified script -- the Benchmark Data Parser!

This is a simple application designed to parse through generated text reports for benchmarks, and is currently working with both CrystalDiskMark and CinebenchR20 and R23.

To use:

1. Save all text reports from benchmarking software to one single folder.
2. Once the app is open and running, follow the prompts and browse to that folder. The app will retrieve all .txt files!
3. Press parse now.
4. Choose the destination folder for your output report.
5. Press create
6. Profit!

This is an internship project and very, very barebones. More support for other apps and other file types will be explored and added in the near future!
